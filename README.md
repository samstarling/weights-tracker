# weights-tracker

This project is designed for me to teach myself React, and was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It's designed for me to keep track of what I do in the gym, allowing for easy editing, and saving to localstorage. It's a playground for me to work out what I'm doing, and learn as I go along. It's probably very messy.
